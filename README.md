# Licredity v1 Core

> **Permissionless, self-custodial credit protocol built on Uniswap v4**

Licredity is a next-generation credit protocol that enables borrowers to mint interest-bearing debt tokens against collateral and deploy them for leveraged positions. The protocol creates a symbiotic credit market where liquidity providers earn enhanced yields through proactive interest donations directly to Uniswap v4 pools.

## üåü Key Features

### Multi-Asset Collateral Support
- **ERC20 Tokens**: Support for fungible token collateral
- **ERC721 NFTs**: Support for non-fungible token collateral
- **Flexible Composition**: Mix different asset types within a single position

### Dynamic Interest Mechanics
- **Price-Responsive Rates**: Interest rates automatically adjust based on pool price dynamics
- **Real-Time Accrual**: Continuous interest calculation tied to market conditions
- **LP Yield Enhancement**: Interest donations directly boost Uniswap v4 liquidity provider returns

### Automated Risk Management
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous position health tracking with configurable risk parameters
- **Multi-Layer Safeguards**: Comprehensive protection through risk parameters, health checks, and automated interventions
- **Liquidation System**: Automated seizure mechanism for unhealthy positions

### Uniswap v4 Integration
- **Native Hooks**: Deep integration with Uniswap v4 hook system
- **Interest Donations**: Direct interest flow to LP positions
- **Pool Synchronization**: Real-time pool state monitoring for interest calculations

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Core Components

**Licredity Contract (`src/Licredity.sol`)**
- Main protocol contract implementing all core functionalities
- Inherits from BaseERC20 (debt token), BaseHooks (Uniswap v4), and governance contracts
- Manages positions, collateral, debt operations, and hook integration

**Position System (`src/types/Position.sol`)**
- Efficient storage-optimized position management
- Dynamic arrays for fungible and non-fungible collateral
- Maintains state consistency through index synchronization

**Type System**
- `Fungible`: Wrapper for ERC20 tokens with metadata
- `NonFungible`: Wrapper for ERC721 tokens
- `FungibleState`: Packed storage for balance and array position data
- `InterestRate`: Interest calculation utilities

**Libraries**
- `FullMath`: High-precision mathematical operations
- `PipsMath`: Price deviation and interest rate calculations
- `Locker`: Reentrancy protection and callback management

### Key Mechanisms

**Two-Step Operations**
Many critical operations use a staging pattern for enhanced security:
1. `stageFungible()` ‚Üí `depositFungible()`
2. `stageNonFungible()` ‚Üí `depositNonFungible()`

**Interest Collection**
Interest accrues during specific operations:
- Position unlocking (`unlock()`)
- Swapping operations
- Liquidity management (add/remove)

**Hook Integration**
The protocol implements Uniswap v4 hooks to:
- Donate accrued interest to liquidity providers
- Monitor pool price deviations
- Trigger interest rate adjustments

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) - Ethereum development toolkit
- [Soldeer](https://soldeer.xyz/) - Dependency management

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Licredity/licredity-v1-core.git
cd licredity-v1-core

# Install dependencies
forge soldeer install

# Build the project
forge build
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
forge test

# Run tests with verbosity
forge test -vvv

# Run specific test contract
forge test --match-contract LicredityUnlockPosition

# Generate coverage report
forge coverage
```

### Deployment

1. **Configure Environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

2. **Deploy to Network**
   ```bash
   # Deploy using script
   forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --broadcast --rpc-url $RPC_URL
   ```

3. **Verify Contract** (optional)
   ```bash
   forge verify-contract <address> Licredity --etherscan-api-key $API_KEY
   ```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Audits

### Formal Verification
The protocol includes comprehensive formal verification using Certora Prover:

- **Valid State Invariants**: Core system consistency properties
- **State Transition Rules**: Correct operation sequencing
- **EIP-20 Compliance**: Debt token standard compliance

Run formal verification:
```bash
cd certora
certoraRun confs/licredity_valid_state_single.conf
```

### External Audits
- [**Cyfrin Audits**](/docs/audits/Cyfrin%202025-09-01.pdf) (2025-09)

### Known Considerations
- Heavy assembly usage for gas optimization - exercise caution when modifying storage operations
- Position array synchronization is critical - maintain consistency between arrays and mappings
- Interest accrual timing is sensitive to transaction ordering
